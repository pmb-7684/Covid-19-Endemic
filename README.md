# Another look at Covid-19

I'm sure we are all sick of talking and thinking about COVID19... it's understandable.  For someone trying to get into the data analytics field, there is a wealth of information available to run analysis, machine learning and visualizations.  The data set I will be working on comes from the John Hopkins' *Whiting School of Engineering* [github ](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData)page.  Their unified dataset is being updated on a weekly, if not daily basis and contains over 31 million rows of covid data from countries around the world.

I plan to use this information to complete 3 smaller projects:

    *  Exploratory data analysis
    *  Visualizations, and 
    *  Machine Learning techniques
    
This project will be completed twice.  First, I will begin working on it in R and later in Python.  Again, looking for a way to practice and improve my skills. I'm not sure what parts will get posted, but it should be an interesting project.
